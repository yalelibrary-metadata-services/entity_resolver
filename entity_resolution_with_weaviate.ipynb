        "## 🎯 Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to use the **Weaviate vector database** and **OpenAI embeddings** to help distinguish between entities with identical names but different domains of activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📚 Learning Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Vector Database Architecture**: How Weaviate stores and indexes text embeddings for semantic search at production scale\n",
        "2. **Semantic Similarity Search**: Finding related entities through cosine similarity in high-dimensional embedding space\n",
        "3. **Subject Imputation Strategy**: Using composite text similarity to fill missing subject fields via weighted centroid algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🔬 Real-World Challenge: The Franz Schubert Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Yale's catalog contains multiple \"Franz Schubert\" entities:\n",
        "- **Franz Schubert, 1806-1893** (artist) → Documentary and Technical Arts  \n",
        "- **Franz Schubert, 1797-1828** (composer) → Music, Sound, and Sonic Arts\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, \"Jean Roberts\" appears as:\n",
        "- Medical researcher (health statistics)\n",
        "- Literary scholar (drama criticism)  \n",
        "- Political writer (economic policy)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Our mission**: Use semantic embeddings to automatically classify and enhance these records.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Vector Database**: Weaviate Cloud with HNSW indexing for sub-linear search performance\n",
        "- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1,536 dimensions) for semantic understanding\n",
        "- **Data Source**: Yale Library catalog records from Hugging Face\n",
