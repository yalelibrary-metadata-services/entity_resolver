## **SLIDE 4: Feature Engineering Innovation**
# **Five Critical Features for Entity Matching**

### **1. Person Cosine Similarity**
- Vector embeddings of personal names
- Captures semantic similarity beyond string matching

### **2. Person-Title Squared Harmonic Mean**
- Combined person and title similarity
- Squared to emphasize high-confidence matches

### **3. Composite Cosine Similarity**  
- Full record context similarity
- Includes roles, subjects, publication details

### **4. Taxonomy Dissimilarity**
- Domain-based classification (SetFit)
- Prevents cross-domain false positives

### **5. Birth/Death Date Matching**
- Regex extraction of biographical dates
- Binary feature for temporal validation

### **Scaling Innovation:** Feature group-specific normalization preserves binary features while optimizing continuous ones.

## **TALKING POINTS & DELIVERY NOTES**

### **Opening (30 seconds):**
"Academic libraries face a massive entity resolution challenge - Yale's catalog alone has 17.6 million name occurrences. Traditional manual approaches simply don't scale. Today I'll show you how we built a machine learning pipeline that achieves 99.55% precision while processing millions of records."

### **Problem Context (45 seconds):**
"The scale is staggering - 4.8 million distinct name variations that could refer to the same person. Richard Strauss alone appears in dozens of different forms. Without automated resolution, researchers miss critical connections, and catalogs remain fragmented."

### **Technical Deep-Dive (90 seconds):**
"Our architecture combines modern NLP with traditional ML. We use OpenAI embeddings for semantic understanding, engineer five critical features including novel birth-death date extraction, and apply gradient boosting for final classification. The key innovation is our standardized scaling approach that maintains consistency between training and production."

### **Results Impact (90 seconds):**
"The results speak for themselves - 99.55% precision means virtually no false positives, while 82% recall captures most true matches. We've reduced computational complexity by 99%, making this scalable to any library system. Franz Schubert's 89 catalog entries are now properly unified."

### **Future Vision (45 seconds):**
"This pipeline is production-ready and opens possibilities for cross-institutional deployment, real-time processing, and continuous learning. We're not just solving entity resolution - we're reimagining how academic libraries can leverage AI to serve researchers better."

### **Q&A Preparation:**
- **Handling different entity types:** "Currently optimized for personal names, but the feature framework extends to organizations, places, and works."
- **Computational costs:** "OpenAI API costs are manageable - roughly $X per million entities processed."
- **Integration complexity:** "Designed as microservices with REST APIs for easy integration with existing library systems."
- **False positive examples:** "Most false positives occur with common names lacking biographical context - future work includes biographical disambiguation."
