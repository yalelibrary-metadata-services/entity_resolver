    "# Yale Entity Resolution: Vector Search and Subject Imputation with Weaviate\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Workshop Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Yale's production entity resolution pipeline! This notebook demonstrates how the Yale University Library uses **Weaviate vector database** and **OpenAI embeddings** to solve the \"Franz Schubert problem\" - distinguishing between entities with identical names but different domains of activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Database Architecture**: How Weaviate stores and indexes text embeddings for semantic search at production scale\n",
    "2. **Entity Resolution Pipeline**: Yale's complete workflow from data ingestion to subject imputation using hot-deck methodology  \n",
    "3. **Semantic Similarity Search**: Finding related entities through cosine similarity in high-dimensional embedding space\n",
    "4. **Subject Imputation Strategy**: Using composite text similarity to fill missing subject fields via weighted centroid algorithms\n",
    "5. **Production Deployment**: Real-world implementation handling 17.6M+ library catalog records with 99.75% precision\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔬 Real-World Challenge: The Franz Schubert Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Yale's catalog contains multiple \"Franz Schubert\" entities:\n",
    "- **Franz Schubert** (photographer, 1978) → Documentary and Technical Arts  \n",
    "- **Franz Schubert, 1797-1828** (composer) → Music, Sound, and Sonic Arts\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, \"Jean Roberts\" appears as:\n",
    "- Medical researcher (health statistics)\n",
    "- Literary scholar (drama criticism)  \n",
    "- Political writer (economic policy)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our mission**: Use semantic embeddings to automatically classify and enhance these records.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Technical Infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Database**: Weaviate Cloud with HNSW indexing for sub-linear search performance\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1,536 dimensions) for semantic understanding\n",
    "- **Data Source**: Yale Library's 17.6M+ MARC 21 catalog records from Hugging Face\n",
    "- **Imputation Method**: Hot-deck centroid algorithm for filling missing subject fields\n",
    "- **Production Scale**: 99.75% precision, 82.48% recall on real library metadata"

    "## 📦 Step 1: Install Dependencies for Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "We need several specialized libraries for this entity resolution pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`weaviate-client`**: Vector database client for storing and searching high-dimensional embeddings with production-grade HNSW indexing\n",
    "- **`datasets`**: Hugging Face library for accessing Yale's public training data (2,539 real catalog records)  \n",
    "- **`openai`**: Access to text-embedding-3-small model that powers Yale's semantic understanding\n",
    "- **`pandas` & `numpy`**: Data manipulation and numerical operations for embedding calculations\n",
    "- **`tqdm`**: Progress tracking for batch operations on large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "These components form Yale's production vector search infrastructure, handling millions of catalog records with sub-second query response times."
