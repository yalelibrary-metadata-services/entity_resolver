    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Set up and configure Weaviate vector database\n",
    "- Create collections optimized for library metadata\n",
    "- Index library catalog records with modern embeddings\n",
    "- Perform semantic similarity searches\n",
    "- Execute complex queries combining vector and keyword search\n",
    "- Apply these techniques to real entity resolution challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Vector Databases for Libraries?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional library catalogs rely on exact keyword matching and controlled vocabularies. But what if a researcher searches for \"musical compositions\" and we have records cataloged under \"symphonies,\" \"sonatas,\" or \"lieder\"? \n",
    "\n",
    "Vector databases like Weaviate solve this by understanding semantic meaning. They can find relevant records even when the exact terms don't match, opening up new possibilities for discovery and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Example**: A search for \"Viennese classical music\" could automatically surface records for Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert, even if those exact terms don't appear in the catalog records."
